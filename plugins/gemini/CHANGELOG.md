# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed
- **AGY 1.1.5 model or reasoning selection is now supported.** Task, review, and adversarial-review validate a selected engine before starting background work, then forward one of AGY's native `--model` or `--effort` flags. AGY model selection requires an exact ID from `agy models`; Gemini aliases fail before spawn, AGY accepts only `low|medium|high`, a model-plus-effort combination fails before spawn, and `--model` is rejected for a dual-engine review because model IDs are engine-specific. AGY versions below stable 1.1.5 reject these options with an upgrade message. Gemini's existing aliases, effort-to-model mapping, and fallback behavior are unchanged.

### Documentation
- Corrected the installation and update guidance: third-party marketplaces do not auto-update by default; this versioned plugin is updated only when its resolved manifest version changes; an update reported during a running session still requires `/reload-plugins`; and a tag-pinned marketplace remains pinned until it is removed and re-added at another tag. No runtime behavior changed.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-07-15 — First-class AGY and Git hardening

### Security
- **Git helpers no longer route repository-derived arguments through a Windows shell.** Every call in `lib/git.mjs` now forces `shell:false` after caller options, so auto-detected refs are passed as literal argv and cannot be reinterpreted by `cmd.exe`. A cross-platform regression creates a valid default ref containing `&`, places an adjacent command probe on `PATH`, and verifies branch target detection and diff collection complete without executing the probe. The test helper now honors an explicit `shell` override. ([#18](https://github.com/arcobaleno64/gemini-plugin-cc/issues/18))

### Changed
- **AGY is documented and reported as a first-class supported engine.** Gemini CLI and AGY are conditional dependencies: users install the CLI for the engine they select, while `auto` keeps capability-based Gemini→AGY ordering because Gemini exposes the plugin's JSON/model contract. Setup now permits the official `curl` installer without incorrectly requiring npm; runtime labels, skills, failure guidance, attribution, and the English/Traditional Chinese READMEs no longer describe AGY as an optional or lower-tier fallback.
- **AGY authentication status is now honest.** AGY 1.1.x uses an independent `consumerOAuth` flow whose state cannot be inferred from Gemini's `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json`. `getAgyLoginStatus()` now returns `state:"unknown"` and `verifiable:false` for an installed AGY binary, instructs users to run `agy` interactively, and never claims the shared Gemini credential proves AGY login. The existing `loggedIn` and `agyFallbackAvailable` fields remain for JSON compatibility; consumers should use `agyAuth.state`, and the additive `agyAvailable` field carries the support-neutral availability signal.

### Documentation
- Added the AGY 1.1.2 macOS/Linux validation checklist and Ubuntu 24.04 WSL2 live evidence for stdin/stdout, foreground task, background task, structured review, invalid-model failure, OAuth TTY/headless behavior, transcript pairing, and the complete Linux test suite. Real macOS 1.1.2 remains explicitly `OPTIONAL / NOT RUN` as a platform-validation gate, not an indication that the AGY engine itself is optional.
- Updated the AGY prompting anti-patterns to distinguish older positional `--print` behavior from the 1.1.2 stdin auto-print path while retaining transcript-authoritative recovery.

### Tests
- The complete Windows suite passes: 238 tests, 235 passed, 0 failed, with 3 POSIX-only AGY fixtures skipped as expected. A real local AGY 1.1.2 `setup --engine agy` smoke reports `agyAvailable:true`, `authState:"unknown"`, and `authVerifiable:false` without reading or exposing credentials.

### Compatibility
- No slash-command flags, engine names, permission policy, transcript recovery, timeout, or task/review result structure changed. Gemini-only and AGY-only installations remain valid; installing both CLIs is not required.

## 0.7.1 — 2026-07-14 — AGY stdin transport

### Changed
- **AGY 1.1.2 and newer now receive prompts on stdin.** The adapter parses `agy --version` and, only for a stable version at or above 1.1.2, omits both `--print` and the prompt from argv so AGY auto-enters print mode from piped input. Older, prerelease, and unparseable versions fail closed to the existing `agy --print <prompt>` path. The 24,000-character and NUL preflight checks now apply only to that positional fallback. Windows still requires an absolute `.exe` and `shell:false`; `--print-timeout`, `--continue`, `--new-project`, and `--dangerously-skip-permissions` behavior is unchanged. (`lib/engine.mjs`, `lib/gemini.mjs`)
- **Transcript recovery remains authoritative.** Both task and review still snapshot the AGY brain directory and use the completed transcript for response text, DONE status, thinking, and conversation ID. Stdout is retained for diagnostics but does not replace the transcript contract, and the 105-second print / 120-second hard timeout strategy remains unchanged. (`lib/agy-transcript.mjs`)

### Tests
- Added version-boundary and argv tests for AGY 1.1.1 versus 1.1.2, including a prompt above the old 24,000-character positional limit. A POSIX fake AGY executable records argv/stdin, emits a conflicting stdout decoy, and writes a DONE transcript to cover task, review, legacy fallback, and transcript precedence. Existing task/review stderr-without-transcript regressions remain in place; Windows is covered by the AGY 1.1.2 live smoke described below.

### Validation
- **AGY 1.1.2 on Windows:** a foreground read-only task completed in 14 seconds and a background task in 13 seconds; both returned their unique marker, no touched files, and a conversation ID that matched a completed on-disk transcript. A one-line synthetic working-tree review completed in 26 seconds, returned structured JSON, and identified the planted wrong-operator defect. A direct invalid-model invocation used stdin with no `--print`, exited 1 in 1.7 seconds, wrote no stdout, and returned a non-empty stderr error plus the available-model list. A larger 53 KB review prompt reached a new transcript but produced no planner response before the existing 105-second print / 120-second hard timeout, which surfaced as `transcript-missing`; this confirms the transport while retaining the documented review-size/time boundary. Real credentials were not revoked, so the upstream OAuth fail-fast path remains documentation-backed rather than live-tested.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-07-14 — MCP bridge and AGY resilience

### Added
- **F-CC1: hand-rolled stdio MCP server.** Added `gemini_rescue`, `gemini_review`, `gemini_job_status`, `gemini_job_result`, and `gemini_job_cancel` as thin JSON-RPC wrappers over the existing companion dispatch, job-control, and state paths. The plugin now declares the server through `.mcp.json`; MCP and CLI background dispatch share the same persisted request construction so prompt assembly cannot drift.
- **F-CC2: parallel blind adversarial review.** `/gemini:adversarial-review --engines gemini,agy` now queues prompt-identical background jobs with one shared group ID, aggregates both engines in `/gemini:status` and `/gemini:result`, and degrades to the available engine with an explicit stderr warning when only one requested CLI is usable.

### Fixed
- **AGY 1.1.2 server-side failures now preserve actionable stderr when transcript recovery has no response.** The task and review runners no longer throw a transcript-only generic error before classifying AGY's non-zero exit. They now pass the exit status, signal, spawn error, stdout, stderr, and transcript reason through the existing failure classifier, so authentication, quota, rate-limit, and model errors take precedence while unknown failures still fall back to the transcript category. Completed transcript responses remain authoritative, and transcript recovery is unchanged. Added isolated fake-AGY runtime coverage for both task and review plus a classifier-precedence regression test. (`lib/gemini.mjs`)
- **`--engine agy --write` no longer silently writes to AGY's scratch dir instead of the target directory.** Machine-verified on AGY 1.1.0/Windows 2026-07-09: a fresh (non-continuation) `agy --print --dangerously-skip-permissions` write turn with no prior workspace/project association creates files under `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/scratch/` rather than the spawned `cwd` — silently, with `status: 0` and no error, so a caller only notices by checking the file landed in the wrong place. `buildCliArgs` now appends `--new-project` on a write turn that is not a `--continue` resume, binding the session's workspace to `cwd`; a resumed conversation is left alone since it already has its original project association. New `tests/engine.test.mjs` coverage for the three `buildCliArgs("agy", ...)` flag-composition cases (write, resumed write, read-only). (`lib/engine.mjs`) Re-verified end-to-end post-commit on AGY 1.1.0/Windows 2026-07-10: a fresh `task --engine agy --write` turn completed in 13s (job `completed`, no `request-review` stall) with the probe file landing in `cwd`, not scratch.

### Documentation
- **AGY 1.1.2 compatibility assessment.** Windows machine validation uses AGY 1.1.2 as the current baseline: read-only foreground and background tasks both completed in 15 seconds or less, returned the expected marker, and matched the conversation ID and on-disk transcript. The isolated fake-AGY review regression and the complete 232-test suite also pass. A corrected direct probe confirmed the new auto-print syntax: supplying the prompt on stdin with no `--print` flag exited 0 and returned the marker on stdout; `--print`, `-p`, and `--prompt` still require their own string argument. With that stdin syntax, an invalid `--model` exited 1, wrote a non-empty error plus the available-model list to stderr, and did not silently fall back. The earlier exit-0 observation was a malformed probe where `--print` consumed `--model` as its prompt argument. The upstream changelog also documents OAuth-code input through `/dev/tty` or Windows `CONIN$` when stdin carries the prompt, plus fail-fast behavior when no controlling terminal exists; real credentials were not revoked to retest that path. Plugin v0.7.0 still uses positional `agy --print <prompt>` and keeps transcript recovery authoritative; the stdin transport is deferred to a version-gated adapter change. The nested-command allowlist change mostly does not affect the plugin's `--write` path because it uses `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, while MCP shutdown cleanup helps only when the user's AGY configuration loads MCP servers. The plugin still does not expose AGY `--agent` selection and does not change its `--write` permission flags.
- **AGY 1.1.0 impact assessment.** AGY 1.1.0 (released 2026-07-08) makes `request-review` the default execution mode: it pauses before file writes to show an interactive line-level diff preview. Machine-verified 2026-07-09 that `--dangerously-skip-permissions` still fully suppresses this pause for a headless `--engine agy --write` turn — no `--mode accept-edits` workaround needed. Also confirmed via `agy --help` on 1.1.0 that the four other flags this plugin depends on (`--print`, `--continue`, `--print-timeout`) are unchanged, and via the upstream tracker that [google-gemini/gemini-cli#27466](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/27466) (`agy --print` empty stdout) remains open as of 2026-06-23, so `agy-transcript.mjs`'s transcript-recovery path is still required. The `/agents` panel global-config-dir fix in 1.1.0 (`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/` → `~/.gemini/config/`) targets subagent definitions, not the transcript "brain" root this plugin reads — no path change there.
  - **Known limitation found, not yet fixed: `getAgyLoginStatus()` is stale for AGY 1.1.0.** It infers AGY's login state from the shared gemini CLI credential file (`~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json`), per a comment asserting "AGY stores no credential of its own." That is no longer true: AGY 1.1.0's `cli.log` shows a distinct `consumerOAuth` flow ("You are not logged into Antigravity" / "authenticated successfully as ...") that is independent of the gemini CLI's OAuth state and is established by running `agy` interactively, not `gemini`. Machine-verified 2026-07-09: `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json` stayed untouched (and reported "expired") through two `gemini`-driven logins, while `agy --print` failed with `authentication failed or timed out` until the user logged in via `agy` directly — after which the shared-credential-based status function would still have reported AGY as logged out. Where AGY 1.1.0 persists its own token was not located (not a plaintext file under `~/.gemini` or `%APPDATA%`/`%LOCALAPPDATA%`; likely OS credential storage), so `getAgyLoginStatus()` was left as-is rather than patched with an unverified detection heuristic.
- **macOS AGY is now platform-verified.** On macOS (agy 1.0.7) the AGY brain root is `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/brain` — the same path already first in `agyBrainRoots()` — so `--engine agy` works out of the box: `gemini-companion.mjs task --engine agy` was run end-to-end on macOS and recovered the response from the transcript (`<conv>/.system_generated/logs/transcript{,_full}.jsonl`, matching the expected layout), and the upstream no-pipe behavior of `agy --print` ([google-gemini/gemini-cli#27466](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/27466)) was reproduced on macOS (0 bytes reach stdout through a pipe), confirming transcript recovery is required there too. Updated README (EN + zh-TW) Engine Routing / Troubleshooting / Known limitations, the `gemini-prompting` antipatterns reference, and the `agy-transcript.mjs` platform notes; TODO-3 (platform paths) is resolved, and the "no brain root" reason string now tells the user to run `agy` once instead of pointing at an internal TODO. No behavior change — comments, docs, and one user-facing message only.
- **README install snippets and dependency table refreshed to the current release.** Pinned-install examples now reference the latest tag `v0.6.6` (was the stale `v0.6.0`), the "newer tag" example bumped to `v0.6.7`, and the AGY dependency row reads `≥ 1.0.3` (1.0.7 verified on macOS). Docs only, no behavior change.

## 0.6.6 — 2026-06-09 — review retry resilience

### Fixed
- **Transient gemini review failures are now retried.** The gemini CLI intermittently returns an empty / `Invalid stream: ...malformed tool call` envelope (or a transport-level rate-limit / unavailability) for an otherwise-valid request; previously a single such flake surfaced to the caller as a parse error and forced a manual re-run (observed needing 2–3 attempts for the same input in practice). `/gemini:review` and `/gemini:adversarial-review` now call `runGeminiReviewResilient`, which re-runs a **read-only** review up to 3 times when the result is transient (empty stdout+stderr, or an `Invalid stream` / `malformed tool call` / `resource_exhausted` / `unavailable` / `5xx` / `429`-class signal with no parseable findings). A review that yields structured findings — or real, non-transient prose — is **never** retried (read-only reviews are idempotent, so the retry is side-effect-free); `agy` is never retried (its transcript-recovery path and fail-fast 2-min timeout handle its distinct failure mode). This composes with the existing GA-fallback retry (model-not-found, fixed within one attempt) rather than replacing it. The transient signal is matched **by channel** to avoid false positives: the malformed-output envelope on either stream, but loose transport words (`unavailable`, `rate limit`, `5xx`, …) only on stderr — so a review whose prose happens to discuss an HTTP status code is not mistaken for a flake; as a backstop, identical non-empty review text across attempts is treated as deterministic output and kept rather than retried. New helper `isTransientReviewFailure`, fixture scenario `review-transient-then-clean`, and regression tests.

## 0.6.5 — 2026-06-04 — low-severity cleanup

### Fixed
- **`/gemini:cancel` no longer claims a kill it did not make.** The detached worker is `unref()`-ed, so by cancel time its PID is often already gone; `handleCancel` discarded `terminateProcessTree`'s return value and always logged "Cancelled by user." It now reports the real outcome — `terminated the running process`, `no live process (it had already exited)`, or `no live process was attached` — in the log, the `# Gemini Cancel` report (a new `- Process:` line), and a new `processTerminated` field on the `--json` payload. The job is still marked `cancelled` in every case (the user's intent is recorded). New shared `describeTermination` helper. (`gemini-companion.mjs`, `lib/render.mjs`)
- **Narrowed the reasoning-noise `[DEP\d+]` filter.** `REASONING_NOISE` matched a bare `[DEP12]` token anywhere, which could strip a genuine reasoning line that merely contained such a bracket. It now requires Node's canonical `(node:NNN) [DEPxxx]` preamble, so real deprecation warnings are still filtered while legitimate reasoning survives. (`lib/gemini.mjs`)

### Tests
- 168 → 172: honest `/cancel` outcome (render-level wording for all three states + a no-pid integration case asserting `processTerminated:false`), the narrowed DEP filter (a `[DEP12]` reasoning line survives while a real `(node:…) [DEP0190]` line is filtered), and a multi-line focus-text round-trip through the background `review-worker`.

### Documentation
- README (EN + zh-TW): added a **Known limitations** section consolidating the documented, non-blocking constraints (macOS AGY unverified, Gemini 3.5 not served by the CLI + 2026-06-18 free-CLI sunset, `/review` prompt-adapter vs native reviewer) with cross-links to the detailed sections.

## 0.6.4 — 2026-06-04 — empty-diff review guard

### Fixed
- **Background review of a clean/empty diff no longer passes vacuously.** `executeReviewRun` now short-circuits when the resolved review target has no changes — a working tree with nothing staged/unstaged/untracked, or a branch diff with no commits and an empty patch — returning an explicit `empty: true` / `result: null` payload rendered as `Nothing to review — <target> has no changes.` instead of asking Gemini to review an empty diff (which it rubber-stamps as "approved"). This closes the v0.6.1-audit gap where a detached `--background` review re-resolved the diff at run time and, if the tree was clean when the worker started, silently persisted a vacuous approve only visible at `/gemini:result`. The foreground and background paths share `executeReviewRun`, so both are covered, and the stop-review-gate stays non-blocking on an empty result (`result: null` → verdict is not `needs-attention`). New `isEmpty` flag on the working-tree/branch review context. (`lib/git.mjs`, `gemini-companion.mjs`)

### Tests
- 166 → 168: an empty working tree review surfaces "nothing to review" without invoking Gemini (the fake-gemini state file is never written); a `--json` empty review carries `empty:true` / `result:null` so the gate proceeds. The pre-existing "adversarial review forwards focus text" test now diverges onto a feature branch so `--base main` resolves to a non-empty diff — it previously exercised the empty-branch-diff path this fix targets.

## 0.6.3 — 2026-06-02 — reasoning-noise filter fix

### Fixed
- **True-color terminal warning leaked into review "Reasoning:".** `REASONING_NOISE` (`lib/gemini.mjs`) only matched the `256-color` terminal-capability warning, but gemini CLI 0.44.1 emits the `True color (24-bit) support not detected` variant. That line matched none of the patterns, so `extractReasoningSummary` kept it and it surfaced as a bogus model-reasoning bullet in review output. Added a `/true color/i` pattern. (The DEP0190 lines seen alongside it during diagnosis were the parent process's own deprecation warning surfaced via a `2>&1` redirect, **not** a filter failure — the v0.6.1 DEP0190 filter works correctly on the subprocess stderr it targets.)

### Tests
- Extended the `review-noisy` fixture/test: it now emits the true-color line on stderr and asserts genuine reasoning still surfaces (`Considering empty-state`) while the true-color warning is filtered out. 166 tests pass.

## 0.6.2 — 2026-06-02 — model resilience, agentic review, transparency

### Added
- **Graceful model-not-found fallback.** If a requested model id is not served by the local gemini CLI (a preview/retired id, or CLI-version skew — e.g. `gemini-3.5-flash` returns 404 on CLI 0.44.1), the plugin retries the run **once** on the GA fallback `gemini-2.5-flash` and shows a visible banner instead of hard-failing. Applies to `/gemini:review`, `/gemini:adversarial-review`, and `/gemini:rescue`; the AGY path is unaffected. (`lib/gemini.mjs`)
- **`--deep` agentic review.** `/gemini:review` and `/gemini:adversarial-review` accept `--deep`, which invites Gemini to use its read-only tools to inspect repo context beyond the diff (dependency manifests, untracked files, callers) before producing the same JSON findings — closing the harness gap versus a native agentic reviewer. The default stays the fast, diff-scoped single-shot review (no behavior change). Verified live: `--deep` flags an undeclared dependency that the diff-scoped review cannot see.
- **Stop-review-gate hook test coverage** (3 deterministic tests: disabled → silent; enabled with no write task → proceed; review-failure → fail-open with a visible warning).
- **`docs/MODEL_COMPARISON.md`** — empirical model-vs-harness comparison and the local model-availability reality; **`docs/PARITY_AUDIT_v0.6.1.md`** — the v0.6.1 re-score.

### Changed
- `model-map`: `lite3` → `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` (verified GA id; drops the `-preview` suffix). Metadata records that Gemini 3.5 is GA on the API but not served by the gemini CLI 0.44.1 (reach it via AGY).
- README (EN + zh-TW): added a 2026-06-18 free-CLI-sunset heads-up, the Gemini 3.5 availability reality (CLI 404 → use AGY), the graceful-fallback note, and `--deep` documentation — so user expectations match reality.

### Tests
- 159 → 166 (model-not-found fallback for review + rescue; `--deep` prompt injection on/off; stop-gate hook coverage).

## 0.6.1 — 2026-06-02 — parity-audit follow-up fixes

### Fixed (P0)
- **`/gemini:rescue` resume prompt never fired.** `handleTaskResumeCandidate` emitted `found`, but `commands/rescue.md` keys the "continue current thread?" prompt off `available` (as upstream codex does). The companion now emits `available` in all branches; a contract guard test asserts `available` is present and the legacy `found` is gone.

### Added (P1)
- **Persistent background reviews.** `/gemini:review --background` and `/gemini:adversarial-review --background` now enqueue a detached `review-worker` (mirroring `task-worker`) instead of relying on Claude-layer `run_in_background`, so a background review result survives an interrupted session and is retrievable via `/gemini:status` / `/gemini:result`. New `review-worker` subcommand; `enqueueBackgroundJob`/`spawnDetachedWorker`/`runStoredJobWorker` generalize the shared machinery.

### Fixed (P1)
- **Stop-review-gate is no longer silent on skip.** On review failure / Gemini-unavailable the gate still fails open, but now surfaces a `systemMessage` + stderr warning so the user knows the gate was skipped. It also reviews `--scope working-tree` explicitly (where `--write` task edits live) instead of relying on auto scope.
- Removed dead `renderNativeReviewResult` from `lib/render.mjs`.

### Fixed (P2)
- **Standard `/gemini:review` mislabeled its progress as "adversarial review".** `runGeminiReview` is now mode-aware (`isAdversarial`).
- **CLI noise leaked into the "Reasoning:" output.** `extractReasoningSummary` now drops DEP0190 deprecation, 256-color, and ripgrep-fallback lines before the last-N slice.
- **Preview-model drift is now visible.** `/gemini:setup` reports the model-alias count, how many resolve to `*-preview` IDs, and the `lastVerified` date.

### Documentation
- README (EN + zh-TW): clarified that `agy --print` is locked to Gemini 3.5 Flash (High) and ignores `--model`/`--effort` (was incorrectly described as interactive selection); noted the DEP0190 warning is benign; documented that AGY transcript recovery is verified on Windows/Linux only (macOS unverified).
- Added `skills/gemini-prompting/references/` (blocks, recipes, anti-patterns), matching upstream `gpt-5-4-prompting`.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-06-01 — parity audit

### Breaking
- **`/gemini:setup` readiness now requires authentication.** `ready` is `true` only when Node **and** the Gemini CLI are present **and** OAuth is valid. An installed-but-unauthenticated Gemini now reports `ready: false` (previously `true`). New JSON fields: `readyState` (`ready` | `partial` | `not-ready`), `geminiReady`, `agyFallbackAvailable`.

### Fixed (P0)
- **Review target was discarded.** `/gemini:review` and `/gemini:adversarial-review` now honour `--base <ref>` and `--scope <auto|working-tree|branch>`; `executeReviewRun` previously re-resolved the target with empty options, silently dropping the user's selection.
- **Contradictory verbatim contract.** Removed the "STOP and ask which issues to fix" instruction from `review.md` / `adversarial-review.md`, which conflicted with the "return stdout verbatim" rule.
- **AGY install was over-eager.** `setup.md` now installs Gemini CLI as the primary engine and only prompts for AGY when the user passes `--engine agy`. Auth guidance is unified on running `gemini` (there is no `gemini login` subcommand).

### Fixed (P0 — post-audit, local-verified on agy 1.0.3 / gemini 0.44.1)
- **AGY install command was wrong (4 sites).** `npm install -g agy` installs an unrelated npm package; replaced with the official installer `curl -fsSL https://antigravity.google/cli/install.sh | bash` in `README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`, `commands/setup.md`, and the `gemini-companion.mjs` setup hint. AGY version baseline pinned to `1.0.3`.
- **AGY silent 10-minute hang.** Local verification showed `agy --print` does not deliver its response over a pipe in non-interactive (non-TTY) use — it returned empty stdout or hung to its print-timeout under the exact piped spawn the plugin uses, while `gemini -p --output-format json` piped a clean JSON envelope every time. AGY's spawn timeout is now capped at 2 min (was 10) in `runGeminiTurn`/`runGeminiReview` so it fails fast instead of hanging, and `getAgyLoginStatus` reports the limitation honestly (and no longer reads the non-existent `status.version` field).
- **engine.mjs auto-branch comment corrected, not deleted.** The note that AGY cannot pipe output non-interactively is accurate (verified), so it was made precise rather than removed; gemini stays the preferred auto engine.

### Not done (local evidence overrode the audit prompt)
- **AGY-first auto routing for personal plans was NOT implemented.** The audit asked for it, but because `agy --print` does not pipe output, defaulting delegation to AGY would make tasks silently fail or hang. Auto-detection keeps gemini first; `--engine agy` / `GEMINI_ENGINE=agy` still force AGY for callers who explicitly want it.
- **Model-id / ListModels reconciliation deferred (needs API key).** `gemini` was confirmed to pipe a valid JSON envelope and to auto-route `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` → `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`; the `flash` alias marketing-name vs API-id check still requires the Generative Language API ListModels endpoint and is left untouched, flagged in `model-map.mjs`.

### Changed (P0-E — AGY transcript mode, v4)
- **AGY recovers its response from the on-disk transcript (#27466 workaround).** `agy --print` never writes its response to stdout under a pipe (upstream bug google-gemini/gemini-cli#27466), so `runGeminiTurn`'s agy branch no longer reads stdout: it snapshots agy's conversation ("brain") dirs before the spawn, then diffs them afterwards and reads the new conversation's `transcript_full.jsonl`/`transcript.jsonl`, returning the last `PLANNER_RESPONSE` row's `content` (with `thinking` as the reasoning summary and `convDir` as the resumable conversation id). New module `scripts/lib/agy-transcript.mjs`.
- **Fail-loud, never silent-empty.** If transcript recovery yields nothing, `runGeminiTurn` throws (citing #27466) instead of returning an empty result. `detectEngine` also refuses an explicit `--engine agy` early when no transcript brain dir exists on this platform (otherwise it permits agy and the transcript path handles it).
- **TODO-3 timeout grace.** agy's own `--print-timeout` is now set ~15 s shorter than the hard spawn kill so agy self-terminates and flushes a final `status:"DONE"` transcript row before `spawnSync` SIGKILLs it; success is judged by that row, not the (often killed) exit code.
- **Local verification (agy 1.0.3, Windows):** transcript path `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/brain/<id>/.system_generated/logs/transcript.jsonl`; `agy --conversation <fresh-uuid>` does NOT pin a self-generated id (antigravity-cli#7 open), so a set-diff is used rather than a known id. `agy --print` is hardcoded to Gemini 3.5 Flash (High) with no model/effort flag — the ignore-note now states this explicitly. End-to-end proof: `task --engine agy` returned the transcript-recovered answer with empty agy stdout.
- **`getAgyLoginStatus` now checks real auth.** AGY stores no credential of its own (verified: no oauth/token file under any `~/.antigravity*` or `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli` dir) and runs off the same Google OAuth as the gemini CLI, so login status is now gauged from that shared `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json` (presence + expiry) instead of mere binary presence.
- **Personal-plan 2026-06-18 EOL warning.** New `getGeminiPlanTier()` reads `~/.gemini/settings.json` (`security.auth.selectedType`); `setup` now appends a heads-up for `oauth-personal` plans that gemini CLI free access ends 2026-06-18, pointing to Gemini Code Assist Standard/Enterprise or the AGY transcript path. Enterprise/unknown tiers stay silent. New JSON field `geminiPlanTier`.
- **`runGeminiReview` agy path now uses transcript recovery too.** The adversarial/standard review path mirrors `runGeminiTurn`: for agy it snapshots brain dirs, applies the timeout grace, recovers the review text from the transcript (parsing the JSON findings out of it), and fails loud if nothing is recoverable — instead of reading the always-empty stdout (#27466).
- **`model-map.mjs` states the AGY model lock explicitly.** The effort-tier comment now records that AGY's `--print` is hardcoded to Gemini 3.5 Flash (High) with no model/effort flag, so tiers apply to the gemini engine only.

### Changed (P2 — engine-aware resume display)
- **`/gemini:result` (and job status) now show the correct per-engine resume command.** gemini jobs show `Gemini session ID` + `gemini --resume <id>` (the old hint used a non-existent `gemini resume` subcommand); AGY jobs show `AGY conversation ID` + `agy --conversation <id>` (the verified resume flag). The resolved engine is persisted on each completed job (`engine` field in the job record), and `render.mjs` derives the hint from it.

### Added (P1)
- **Claude session job filtering.** `/gemini:status --all` now crosses sessions (default stays scoped to the current Claude session); resume-candidate and active-task checks respect the session boundary.
- **Single source of truth for models.** New `scripts/lib/model-map.mjs` holds aliases + effort tiers + provenance (`lastVerified`, `source`, preview flags); the README table is verified against it.
- **Contract verification.** New `scripts/verify-contracts.mjs` (`npm run verify-contracts`) and ported `scripts/bump-version.mjs` (`npm run check-version` / `bump-version`). CI now runs `npm test`, `check-version`, and `verify-contracts`.
- `getSessionRuntimeStatus` now returns a `label`/`mode` so setup/status no longer render `session runtime: undefined`.

### Tests
- 90 → 117 tests. New coverage: `--base`/`--scope` divergence, setup readiness (auth missing/expired/AGY-fallback), session filtering, stdin prompt safety (metacharacter matrix), stderr-does-not-pollute-JSON, model-map/README consistency, and contract/version verification.

### Documentation
- README (EN + zh-TW): Compatibility Matrix, Codex app server vs Gemini CLI adapter, expanded Security Notes, Setup & Auth Troubleshooting, Model Alias Notes, and Upstream Attribution.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-05-27

### Added
- `/gemini:review` — standard (non-adversarial) code review; finds real bugs, missing error handling, and incomplete paths.
- `prompts/review.md` — pragmatic reviewer prompt template (same JSON output schema as adversarial-review).
- Review Gate fully implemented: `stop-review-gate-hook.mjs` now runs `adversarial-review` before session end when any `--write` task completed; blocks with finding summary if verdict is `needs-attention`.
- `/gemini:setup --enable-review-gate` / `--disable-review-gate` flags to toggle the gate without editing config JSON.
- `setup` output now includes `review gate: enabled/disabled` status.

### Fixed
- `buildSetupReport` now reads `reviewGateEnabled` from config and passes it to `renderSetupReport` — previously always rendered as "disabled".
- `commands/result.md` now mentions `/gemini:review --wait` in follow-up suggestions.

### Documentation
- README: `/gemini:rescue` flags table now includes `--fresh` (force new session).
- README: `/gemini:result` section now explains the `Resume in Gemini: gemini resume <session-id>` output.
- README: new Review Gate section with enable/disable instructions.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-05-27

### Added
- Gemini 3.x model aliases: `flash`/`flash3` → `gemini-3.5-flash` (GA), `pro`/`pro3` → `gemini-3.1-pro`, `lite3` → `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`.
- Backward-compat aliases `flash25` → `gemini-2.5-flash`, `pro25` → `gemini-2.5-pro`.
- `effort` mapping updated: `low`/`medium` → `gemini-3.5-flash`, `high`/`xhigh` → `gemini-3.1-pro`.
- `task-resume-candidate` now guards against active/queued tasks (mirrors `resolveLatestTrackedTaskThread` guard).

### Fixed
- `renderSetupReport` was reading `report.auth.detail` (field does not exist); corrected to `report.geminiAuth.detail` and `report.agyAuth.detail`.
- `verdict ?? outcome` alias in `validateReviewResultShape` / `normalizeReviewResultData` now uses `||` — `??` failed to fall through when `verdict` was an empty string.
- `detectEngine` was reading `status.version` (field does not exist on `binaryAvailable` return); corrected to `status.detail`.
- `detectEngine` now throws on unknown engine values instead of silently falling back to auto.
- Removed `preview` alias that mapped to the non-existent `gemini-3-pro-preview`.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-05-27

### Added
- Marketplace installation support: `/plugin marketplace add arcobaleno64/gemini-plugin-cc`
- Session ID (`threadId`) extraction from Gemini CLI JSON envelope in task runs — enables `--resume-last` to work correctly.
- `GEMINI_HOME` environment variable support for non-standard credential paths.

### Fixed
- `appendReasoningSection` now accepts both `string` (from `gemini.mjs`) and `Array` — reasoning output was silently dropped before this fix.
- `runCommand` null `status` now resolves to `1` when the process was killed by a signal or failed to spawn, instead of masking failures as exit `0`.
- `marketplace.json` and `plugin.json` updated with correct owner (`arcobaleno64`), repository URL, and version `0.3.0`.
- README installation section updated with proper marketplace workflow.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-05-27

### Fixed
- **P0 Windows ENOENT**: Replaced custom `runSpawn` (`shell: false`) with `runCommand` from `process.mjs` (`shell: true` on Windows), resolving failure to execute `.cmd` wrappers installed by npm.
- **P0 Shell injection**: Gemini CLI prompts are now delivered via stdin (`input` option) instead of the `-p` CLI argument, eliminating shell metacharacter injection on Windows (`shell: true` path).
- **P0 AGY pipe output**: `auto` engine order swapped — `gemini` CLI is now preferred; `agy` is fallback. AGY cannot write to a pipe in non-interactive mode and silently returned empty output as the former default.
- **P1 `task-resume-candidate` missing**: Added `handleTaskResumeCandidate` handler and `task-resume-candidate` subcommand to `gemini-companion.mjs`; previously caused `Unknown subcommand` errors from `gemini:rescue`.
- **P2 OAuth token expiry**: `getGeminiLoginStatus()` now parses `oauth_creds.json` and reports expired tokens before any invocation attempt, rather than only checking for file existence.

### Added
- `runCommand` now accepts `maxBuffer` and `timeout` options (forwarded to `spawnSync`).
- `buildCliArgs` accepts `useStdin` flag; when set for the `gemini` engine, the prompt is omitted from the args array and must be supplied via `input`.
- `README.md` and `README.zh-TW.md` with full command reference, security notes, and architecture diagram.
- `.gitignore` excluding `.omc/` runtime state directory.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-05-26

### Added
- `gemini-companion.mjs` runtime with AGY auto-detect and Gemini CLI fallback
- `session-lifecycle-hook.mjs` for `GEMINI_COMPANION_SESSION_ID` injection on SessionStart/End
- `stop-review-gate-hook.mjs` stub (opt-in via `stopReviewGateEnabled` config)
- Slash commands: `/gemini:setup`, `/gemini:rescue`, `/gemini:result`, `/gemini:status`, `/gemini:cancel`, `/gemini:adversarial-review`
- Skills: `gemini-cli-runtime`, `gemini-prompting`, `gemini-result-handling`
- Agent: `gemini-rescue` — thin forwarder to the companion task runtime
- `hooks/hooks.json` — SessionStart, SessionEnd, Stop hooks
- Engine routing: AGY preferred, Gemini CLI fallback; `--engine agy|gemini` to force
- Model aliases: `flash` → gemini-2.5-flash, `pro` → gemini-2.5-pro, `lite` → gemini-2.5-flash-lite
