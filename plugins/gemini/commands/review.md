Run a standard Gemini code review against the current git state through the shared plugin runtime.
It is a pragmatic reviewer that finds real bugs, missing error handling, and incomplete code paths.

Raw slash-command arguments:
`$ARGUMENTS`

Core constraint:
- This command is review-only.
- Do not fix issues, apply patches, or suggest that you are about to make changes.
- Your only job is to run the review and return Gemini's output verbatim to the user.

Execution mode rules:
- If the raw arguments include `--wait`, do not ask. Run the review in the foreground.
- If the raw arguments include `--background`, do not ask. Run the review in a Claude background task.
- Otherwise, estimate the review size before asking:
  - For working-tree review, start with `git status --short --untracked-files=all`.
  - For working-tree review, also inspect both `git diff --shortstat --cached` and `git diff --shortstat`.
  - For base-branch review, use `git diff --shortstat <base>...HEAD`.
  - Treat untracked files or directories as reviewable work even when `git diff --shortstat` is empty.
  - Only conclude there is nothing to review when the relevant working-tree status is empty or the explicit branch diff is empty.
  - Recommend waiting only when the review is clearly tiny, roughly 1-2 files total and no sign of a broader directory-sized change.
  - In every other case, including unclear size, recommend background.
  - When in doubt, run the review instead of declaring that there is nothing to review.
- Then use `AskUserQuestion` exactly once with two options, putting the recommended option first and suffixing its label with `(Recommended)`:
  - `Wait for results`
  - `Run in background`

Argument handling:
- Preserve the user's arguments exactly.
- Do not strip `--wait` or `--background` yourself.
- Do not add extra review instructions or rewrite the user's intent.
- The companion script handles `--background` itself: it enqueues the review and spawns a detached `review-worker`, so the result persists even if this session ends. Do not use Claude's `run_in_background: true` for it.
- `/gemini:review` is native-review only. It does not take custom focus text.
- For an adversarial review that challenges design decisions, use `/gemini:adversarial-review`.
- `--deep` runs an **agentic** review: Gemini uses its read-only tools to inspect repo context beyond the diff (dependency manifests, untracked files, callers) before producing the same JSON findings. It is slower and uses more tokens; omit it for the fast, diff-scoped default. Pair `--deep` with `--background` for larger changes.

Foreground flow:
- Run:
```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/gemini-companion.mjs" review "$ARGUMENTS"
```
- Return the command stdout verbatim, exactly as-is.
- Do not paraphrase, summarize, or add commentary before or after it.
- Do not fix any issues mentioned in the review output.
- If the helper reports that Gemini/AGY is missing or unauthenticated, stop and tell the user to run `/gemini:setup`.

Background flow:
- Run the companion with its own `--background` flag in the FOREGROUND (the companion detaches its own worker and returns immediately):
```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/gemini-companion.mjs" review --background "$ARGUMENTS"
```
- This enqueues the review, spawns a detached `review-worker`, and returns a job id right away. The result persists even if this Claude session is interrupted.
- Do not use `run_in_background: true` and do not call `BashOutput` — the companion already detached; this call returns immediately.
- Relay the returned job id: "Gemini review started in the background as `<job-id>`. Check `/gemini:status <job-id>` for progress and `/gemini:result <job-id>` when it finishes."
