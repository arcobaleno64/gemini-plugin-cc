Run an adversarial Gemini review through the shared plugin runtime.
Position it as a challenge review that questions the chosen implementation, design choices, tradeoffs, and assumptions.
It is not just a stricter pass over implementation defects.

Raw slash-command arguments:
`$ARGUMENTS`

Core constraint:
- This command is review-only.
- Do not fix issues, apply patches, or suggest that you are about to make changes.
- Your only job is to run the review and return Gemini's output verbatim to the user.
- Keep the framing focused on whether the current approach is the right one, what assumptions it depends on, and where the design could fail under real-world conditions.

Execution mode rules:
- If the raw arguments include `--engines`, do not ask. Run the companion in the foreground with those arguments; the runtime queues the grouped jobs in the background and returns the group ID immediately.
- If the raw arguments include `--wait`, do not ask. Run in the foreground.
- If the raw arguments include `--background`, do not ask. Run in a Claude background task.
- Otherwise, estimate the review size before asking:
  - For working-tree review, start with `git status --short --untracked-files=all`.
  - For working-tree review, also inspect both `git diff --shortstat --cached` and `git diff --shortstat`.
  - For base-branch review, use `git diff --shortstat <base>...HEAD`.
  - Treat untracked files or directories as reviewable work even when `git diff --shortstat` is empty.
  - Only conclude there is nothing to review when the relevant scope is actually empty.
  - Recommend waiting only when the scoped review is clearly tiny, roughly 1-2 files total and no sign of a broader directory-sized change.
  - In every other case, including unclear size, recommend background.
  - When in doubt, run the review instead of declaring that there is nothing to review.
- Then use `AskUserQuestion` exactly once with two options, putting the recommended option first and suffixing its label with `(Recommended)`:
  - `Wait for results`
  - `Run in background`

Argument handling:
- Preserve the user's arguments exactly.
- Do not strip `--wait` or `--background` yourself.
- Do not weaken the adversarial framing or rewrite the user's focus text.
- The companion script handles `--background` itself: it enqueues the review and spawns a detached `review-worker`, so the result persists even if this session ends. Do not use Claude's `run_in_background: true` for it.
- `/gemini:adversarial-review` uses the same review target selection as `/gemini:review` (including `--base <ref>` and `--scope`).
- Unlike `/gemini:review`, it can take extra focus text after the flags.
- `--engines gemini,agy` queues the same blind prompt on both available engines as a background group. The jobs share a group ID but do not receive each other's identity or output. Do not combine `--engines` with `--engine` or `--wait`.
- If one requested engine is unavailable, the runtime prints a degradation warning to stderr and queues the remaining engine as a normal single job. If neither is available, it fails without creating a job.
- `--deep` runs an **agentic** review: Gemini uses its read-only tools to inspect repo context beyond the diff (dependency manifests, untracked files, callers) before producing the same JSON findings. Slower and higher-token; omit it for the fast, diff-scoped default. Pair `--deep` with `--background` for larger changes.

Foreground flow:
- Run:
```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/gemini-companion.mjs" adversarial-review "$ARGUMENTS"
```
- Return the command stdout verbatim, exactly as-is.
- Do not paraphrase, summarize, or add commentary before or after it.
- Do not fix any issues mentioned in the review output.
- If the helper reports that Gemini/AGY is missing or unauthenticated, stop and tell the user to run `/gemini:setup`.

Background flow:
- Run the companion with its own `--background` flag in the FOREGROUND (the companion detaches its own worker and returns immediately):
```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/gemini-companion.mjs" adversarial-review --background "$ARGUMENTS"
```
- This enqueues the review, spawns a detached `review-worker`, and returns a job id right away. The result persists even if this Claude session is interrupted.
- Do not use `run_in_background: true` and do not call `BashOutput` — the companion already detached; this call returns immediately.
- Relay the returned job id: "Gemini adversarial review started in the background as `<job-id>`. Check `/gemini:status <job-id>` for progress and `/gemini:result <job-id>` when it finishes."
- For `--engines`, relay the returned group ID instead: "Gemini adversarial review group started as `<group-id>`. Check `/gemini:status <group-id>` for both engines and `/gemini:result <group-id>` for their verdicts."
