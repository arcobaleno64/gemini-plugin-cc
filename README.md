# Gemini / Antigravity Companion for Claude Code

> Use Gemini CLI or Antigravity CLI (`agy`) inside Claude Code for task delegation, pragmatic code review, and adversarial review.

**Transition-ready for Google's Gemini CLI to Antigravity CLI migration.**
`gemini-plugin-cc` keeps the familiar Claude Code slash-command workflow while letting you route work to Gemini CLI where available, or to Antigravity CLI (`agy`) during the post-June-2026 transition.

[繁體中文說明 →](README.zh-TW.md)

Ported from [openai/codex-plugin-cc](https://github.com/openai/codex-plugin-cc) (Apache-2.0) — same slash-command UX, same background job model, same skill contract — powered by the Gemini ecosystem instead of OpenAI.

---

## Why this plugin?

`gemini-plugin-cc` is a Claude Code-native companion bridge for users who want both Gemini CLI and Antigravity CLI (`agy`) support during Google's Gemini CLI transition.

Compared with AGY-only, multi-host plugins, this project keeps the Gemini CLI path where available while providing an explicit `--engine agy` route for users migrating to Antigravity CLI.

- Claude Code-native `/gemini:*` slash commands.
- Pragmatic and adversarial code review over the current diff or branch.
- Background task delegation for longer-running companion-agent work.
- Gemini model aliases, graceful model fallback, and transient review retry.
- Version-gated AGY prompt transport with transcript-authoritative recovery.
- Safer stdin prompt delivery on Gemini and AGY 1.1.2 or newer.

| Need | Use this plugin when... |
|---|---|
| Gemini CLI still works for you | You want model selection, JSON output, and stdin prompt delivery. |
| You are migrating to AGY | Use `--engine agy` as the fully supported Antigravity CLI backend. |
| You want adversarial review | Use `/gemini:adversarial-review` with optional focus text. |
| You need AGY-only multi-host support | Consider an AGY-only plugin instead. |

## Features

- **`/gemini:rescue`** — Delegate investigation, debugging, or implementation tasks to the selected Gemini CLI or AGY engine. Runs in the foreground or detached in the background.
- **`/gemini:review`** — Standard (pragmatic) code review over the current diff or branch. Finds real bugs, missing error handling, and incomplete code paths. Add `--deep` for an agentic pass that explores repo context beyond the diff.
- **`/gemini:adversarial-review`** — Adversarial code review that challenges design decisions over the current diff or branch. Returns structured findings with severity ratings.
- **`/gemini:setup`** — Check Gemini CLI / AGY availability and OAuth status.
- **`/gemini:status`** — Inspect active and completed background jobs.
- **`/gemini:result`** / **`/gemini:cancel`** — Retrieve or cancel a background job.
- **Engine auto-detection** — Both engines are first-class; `auto` checks `gemini` first for its JSON/model contract, then `agy`.
- **Version-aware stdin prompt delivery** — Gemini always uses stdin; AGY 1.1.2 or newer uses its auto-print stdin path, while older or unknown versions retain the compatible positional path.
- **Session lifecycle hooks** — Automatically injects `GEMINI_COMPANION_SESSION_ID`; cleans up stale jobs on session end.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Install |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | ≥ 18 | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| Gemini CLI | ≥ 0.40; required for the `gemini` engine | `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli` |
| AGY | ≥ 1.0.3; ≥ 1.1.2 recommended and live-verified on Windows/Ubuntu WSL2 | _(see install note below)_ |
| Claude Code | any | [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code) |

**Install AGY** (required for `--engine agy`): `curl -fsSL https://antigravity.google/cli/install.sh | bash`

**Authentication**: Each engine authenticates independently. Run `gemini` once for the Gemini engine, or run `agy` once interactively for the AGY engine. AGY authentication cannot be verified reliably from a headless setup probe, so `/gemini:setup --engine agy` reports it as unknown until a real AGY command succeeds. No API key is required.

> **Heads-up (reality check):**
> - **2026-06-18 consumer transition**: Google announced that free/personal, Google AI Pro, and Google AI Ultra Gemini CLI requests stop being served after this date; Standard/Enterprise access remains. See Google's [Gemini CLI to Antigravity CLI announcement](https://developers.googleblog.com/an-important-update-transitioning-gemini-cli-to-antigravity-cli/).
> - **Model availability drifts by CLI version.** In the 2026-06-02 probe against gemini CLI 0.44.1, `gemini-3.5-*` returned `404 ModelNotFound`; newer CLI releases may differ. The plugin gracefully falls back to a GA model if a requested id is unavailable. See [Model Aliases](#model-aliases) and [docs/MODEL_COMPARISON.md](docs/MODEL_COMPARISON.md).

## Installation

### Latest (tracks `main`, auto-updates)

```
# 1. Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add arcobaleno64/gemini-plugin-cc

# 2. Install the plugin
/plugin install gemini@gemini-plugin-cc

# 3. Reload plugins
/reload-plugins
```

### Pinned release (a specific published version)

Pin the marketplace to a release tag — e.g. `v0.8.0`:

```
/plugin marketplace add arcobaleno64/gemini-plugin-cc@v0.8.0
/plugin install gemini@gemini-plugin-cc
/reload-plugins
```

> Claude Code installs plugins from the git tree, not from GitHub Release tarballs — `@<tag>` selects the git tag behind a [Release](https://github.com/arcobaleno64/gemini-plugin-cc/releases). A pinned install does **not** auto-update; to move to a newer release, re-add the marketplace with the new tag (e.g. `…@v0.8.1`).

Then run `/gemini:setup` for `auto`/Gemini, or `/gemini:setup --engine agy` for AGY. The selected engine is the only engine dependency that must be installed; setup offers the matching installer when it is missing.

If Gemini is installed but not authenticated yet, run:

```
!gemini
```

---

## Quick Start

```
# Delegate a task to Gemini (foreground)

# Run in the background and check later
/gemini:rescue --background Add unit tests for the UserService class
/gemini:status

# Adversarial review of your current diff
/gemini:adversarial-review

# Review with a specific focus
/gemini:adversarial-review Focus on race conditions in the job queue
```

---

## Commands

### `/gemini:rescue [prompt]`

Delegates a task to Gemini. Reads from stdin if no prompt is given.

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--background` | Run detached; returns a job ID immediately |
| `--write` | Allow Gemini to modify files (`--yolo` / `--dangerously-skip-permissions`) |
| `--resume-last` | Continue the most recent Gemini session |
| `--fresh` | Force a new Gemini session, ignoring any resumable thread |
| `--engine <gemini\|agy\|auto>` | Override engine selection |
| `--model <alias\|id>` | Model override (`flash`, `pro`, `lite`) |
| `--effort <low\|medium\|high\|xhigh>` | Map effort level to a model |

### `/gemini:review`

Runs a standard, pragmatic review over the current working tree or branch diff — real bugs, missing error handling, and incomplete code paths. Not steerable and takes no focus text; use `/gemini:adversarial-review` to challenge a specific decision.

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--wait` / `--background` | Run in the foreground or detached |
| `--deep` | Agentic review — let Gemini explore repo context beyond the diff (slower, higher-token; gemini engine) |
| `--base <ref>` | Compare against a specific git ref |
| `--scope <auto\|working-tree\|branch>` | Diff scope |
| `--engine <gemini\|agy\|auto>` | Override engine |
| `--model <alias\|id>` | Model override |

### `/gemini:adversarial-review [focus]`

Runs an adversarial review over the current working tree or branch diff.

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--deep` | Agentic review — let Gemini explore repo context beyond the diff (slower, higher-token; gemini engine) |
| `--base <ref>` | Compare against a specific git ref |
| `--scope <auto\|working-tree\|branch>` | Diff scope |
| `--engine <gemini\|agy\|auto>` | Override engine |
| `--model <alias\|id>` | Model override |

### `/gemini:setup`

Prints availability and auth status for Node, Gemini CLI, and AGY.

### `/gemini:status [job-id]`

Lists active and recent background jobs. Pass a job ID to inspect a single job.

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--wait` | Block until the job completes (requires a job ID) |
| `--all` | Show all jobs, not just this session's |

### `/gemini:result [job-id]`

Retrieves the output of a completed job. If the job has a Gemini session ID, the output includes `Resume in Gemini: gemini --resume <session-id>` — paste that into a terminal to continue the session in Gemini CLI directly.

### `/gemini:cancel [job-id]`

Cancels a running or queued background job.

---

## Review Gate (Optional)

An optional stop-time gate that runs an adversarial review before Claude Code can stop, whenever a `--write` task completed in the session. Disabled by default.

Enable or disable via `/gemini:setup`:

```
# Enable
/gemini:setup --enable-review-gate

# Disable
/gemini:setup --disable-review-gate
```

When enabled and the review returns `needs-attention`, Claude Code is blocked from stopping and shown the finding summary. Run `/gemini:adversarial-review --wait` to review the findings and decide whether to accept or fix them before continuing.

---

## Model Aliases

| Alias | Resolved Model | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `flash` / `flash3` | `gemini-3-flash-preview` | Gemini 3 Flash (preview) |
| `pro` / `pro3` | `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` | Gemini 3.1 Pro (preview) |
| `flash25` | `gemini-2.5-flash` | Stable 2.5 Flash (GA) |
| `pro25` | `gemini-2.5-pro` | Stable 2.5 Pro (GA) |
| `lite` / `fast` | `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` | Cost-efficient (GA) |
| `lite3` | `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` | Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite (GA, cost-efficient) |

### Model Alias Notes

- Aliases and effort tiers live in a single source of truth — `plugins/gemini/scripts/lib/model-map.mjs` — and `npm test` verifies the table above against it, so the two cannot drift.
- **Effort mapping** (applied when `--effort` is given without `--model`): `none`/`minimal` → `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`; `low`/`medium` → `gemini-3-flash-preview`; `high`/`xhigh` → `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`.
- **CLI probe snapshot.** The alias table reflects the model-map probe from 2026-06-02 against gemini CLI 0.44.1. Newer Gemini CLI releases may serve different model IDs. If an alias stops resolving, override it with `--model <exact-id>` — any value that is not a known alias is passed through to the CLI unchanged.
- **Gemini 3.5 availability can drift.** The 2026-06-02 gemini CLI 0.44.1 probe returned `404 ModelNotFound` for `gemini-3.5-flash` and `gemini-3.5-pro`; newer CLI releases may differ. Unknown or unavailable model IDs degrade gracefully to the GA fallback.
- **Graceful model fallback.** If a requested model id is not found on your gemini CLI (preview/retired id, or a CLI-version mismatch), the plugin retries the run **once on the GA fallback `gemini-2.5-flash`** and prints a clear note — so a stale id degrades gracefully instead of hard-failing.
- **AGY model selection is not managed by this plugin yet.** Some AGY versions expose their own `--model` surface, but `--engine agy` currently runs through AGY's configured/default model and the plugin does not translate `--model` or `--effort` to AGY arguments. Use `--engine gemini` for plugin-managed model selection.

---

## Engine Routing

In `auto` mode the plugin selects the first available engine in this order:

1. **`gemini` CLI** — outputs via stdout; supports stdin prompt delivery.
2. **`agy`** — first-class supported engine and second `auto` candidate; AGY 1.1.2 or newer receives the prompt on stdin with no `--print` flag, while older or unknown versions retain `agy --print <prompt>`.

Override via `--engine` flag or the `GEMINI_ENGINE` environment variable.

> `--model` and `--effort` are managed by the **gemini** engine only. `--engine agy` currently leaves model choice to AGY's configured/default behavior; the plugin does not translate Gemini aliases or effort tiers to AGY arguments.

> **AGY transcript recovery remains authoritative.** Positional `agy --print` produced no piped response on older releases (upstream [google-gemini/gemini-cli#27466](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/27466); reproduced on macOS AGY 1.0.7). Plugin v0.7.1 uses the auto-print stdin path on AGY 1.1.2 or newer, but still takes the completed response, DONE status, thinking, and conversation ID from the on-disk transcript. Known brain roots are `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/brain` (verified on Windows, macOS AGY 1.0.7, and Linux AGY 1.1.2) and `~/.antigravity-cli/brain` (older Linux 1.0.2, reported). The 1.1.2 stdin path is live-verified on Windows and Ubuntu 24.04 WSL2, and covered by a POSIX integration fixture; real macOS 1.1.2 verification is intentionally optional and has not been run. If no brain root is found, run `agy` once or open an issue with its actual location.

---

## Security

- **Stdin delivery**: Gemini prompts and AGY 1.1.2-or-newer prompts use Node's `spawnSync` `input` option and never enter argv. AGY versions older than 1.1.2, plus unparseable versions, keep the positional compatibility path and its 24,000-character limit; prefer Gemini or AGY 1.1.2+ for untrusted prompt content.
- **Windows process boundary**: Gemini's npm `.cmd` shim is launched through `shell:true`, but its prompt remains on stdin and only validated flags enter argv. AGY must resolve to an absolute `.exe` and is always launched with `shell:false`.
- **Git process boundary**: Repository-derived refs are always passed to Git as literal argv with `shell:false`, including on Windows; Git helpers never inherit the `.cmd` wrapper fallback.
- **DEP0190 warning is benign**: On Windows you may see `(node:NNN) [DEP0190] DeprecationWarning: Passing args to a child process with shell option true can lead to security vulnerabilities, as the arguments are not escaped, only concatenated.` This is **safe to ignore here** — the deprecation is about *prompt content* placed in argv under `shell: true`, but this plugin never does that for the gemini engine: the prompt travels on stdin, and only controlled flags reach argv (each validated, e.g. model ids must match `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*$`). The warning is Node flagging the general pattern, not an actual injection vector in this code path.
- **AGY transport fallback**: Only a stable parsed version of 1.1.2 or newer enables stdin. Unknown and prerelease version strings fail closed to the existing positional path, preserving compatibility rather than assuming an upstream capability.
- **Credential handling**: OAuth credentials in `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json` are read only to check token expiry via `getGeminiLoginStatus()`; they are never logged, copied elsewhere, or transmitted by this plugin.
- **`.gitignore`**: The `.omc/` state directory (job logs, session state) is excluded from version control.

## Setup & Auth Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `gemini: not found` | Gemini CLI not installed | `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli`, or run `/gemini:setup` and accept the install prompt |
| `npm: not found` | Node/npm missing from PATH | Install Node.js ≥ 18 from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| setup shows `gemini auth: No credentials …` | OAuth not completed | Run `!gemini` once and complete the browser login |
| setup shows `… token expired` | OAuth token lapsed | Run `!gemini` again to refresh credentials |
| `Status: partial (AGY available …)` | Gemini CLI unavailable but AGY present | Use `--engine agy` directly; setup keeps AGY auth `unknown` because it cannot verify the independent AGY OAuth flow non-interactively |
| Windows: command resolves but fails | `.cmd` wrapper / PATH | Confirm `where gemini` resolves; the plugin spawns bare names through `shell: true` to find `.cmd` shims |
| `--engine agy` reports no brain root | AGY has not created its brain directory yet, or it lives in an unknown location | Run `agy` once so it creates the brain dir. Known roots: `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/brain` (verified on Windows, macOS AGY 1.0.7, and Linux AGY 1.1.2) and `~/.antigravity-cli/brain` (older Linux 1.0.2, reported); if yours differs, open an issue with its location |

For the Gemini engine, run **`!gemini`** once — the plugin completes OAuth by invoking `gemini` itself. There is **no** `gemini login` subcommand. For the AGY engine, run `agy` interactively once; its separate OAuth state is not inferred from Gemini's `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json`. `setup` reports AGY as `partial` while the binary is present but auth remains unverifiable.

---

## How It Works

```
Claude Code
  └─ /gemini:rescue "prompt"
       └─ gemini-companion.mjs task
            ├─ detectEngine()        → gemini | agy
            ├─ buildCliArgs()        → version-gated args
            ├─ runCommand()          → spawnSync
            │    input: prompt       ← gemini + AGY ≥1.1.2
            │    argv: prompt        ← older/unknown AGY only (24K cap)
            └─ renderTaskResult()   → Markdown output to Claude
```

Background mode spawns a detached worker child process (`task-worker` for `/gemini:rescue`, `review-worker` for `/gemini:review` and `/gemini:adversarial-review`) and returns a job ID immediately. State is persisted in `.omc/state/` and polled via `/gemini:status`, so a background result survives even if the Claude session is interrupted.

## Parity with codex-plugin-cc

This plugin is a high-fidelity port of [openai/codex-plugin-cc](https://github.com/openai/codex-plugin-cc). The public slash-command surface, background job model, and state/result/status/cancel flow mirror the upstream; the execution backends are the first-class Gemini CLI and AGY engines rather than the Codex app server.

### Compatibility Matrix

| Upstream (Codex) | This plugin (Gemini) | Parity |
|---|---|---|
| `/codex:setup` | `/gemini:setup` | **Gemini-specific divergence** — checks Gemini OAuth or AGY binary readiness for the selected first-class engine instead of Codex auth |
| `/codex:review` | `/gemini:review` | **best-effort equivalent** — prompt / CLI-adapter review, not a native reviewer |
| `/codex:adversarial-review` | `/gemini:adversarial-review` | **best-effort equivalent** — adversarial prompt over the same diff target |
| `/codex:rescue` | `/gemini:rescue` | **1:1 parity** — same forwarder/subagent contract and flags |
| `/codex:status` | `/gemini:status` | **1:1 parity** — same job model; `--all` crosses Claude sessions |
| `/codex:result` | `/gemini:result` | **Gemini-specific divergence** — surfaces the Gemini session id + `gemini --resume` |
| `/codex:cancel` | `/gemini:cancel` | **1:1 parity** — same process-tree termination (POSIX + Windows) |

### Codex app server vs Gemini CLI adapter

- **Runtime**: Codex uses a persistent app-server with native review and persistent threads. This plugin invokes the selected first-class Gemini CLI or AGY engine directly *per command* (no shared runtime); `auto` uses capability-based Gemini→AGY ordering.
- **Standard review**: In the Codex plugin, `/codex:review` is a *native* reviewer. Here, `/gemini:review` is a **prompt-based / CLI-adapter equivalent** — it sends the diff to Gemini with a pragmatic-review prompt and parses structured JSON back. It is not a native Gemini reviewer.
- **Sandbox**: Codex exposes `read-only` / `workspace-write` sandboxes. Gemini has no equivalent; write access is gated by `--write` (`--yolo`), and otherwise the prompt enforces read-only discipline. (`--approval-mode plan` is intentionally not used: it requires a TTY and conflicts with stdin prompt delivery.)
- **Thread/session resume**: Codex persists threads on the app server. Here, resume relies on the Gemini CLI **session id** captured from the JSON envelope; `/gemini:result` prints `gemini --resume <session-id>`, and `--resume-last` continues the latest thread *for the current Claude session*.

## Skills

Three skills are bundled for Claude Code to consume:

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `gemini-cli-runtime` | Runtime contract — how to call `gemini-companion task` |
| `gemini-result-handling` | Result presentation rules (severity, reasoning, evidence) |
| `gemini-prompting` | Prompt composition guide (XML tags, output contract) |

---

## Known limitations

Documented, non-blocking constraints — see the linked sections for detail:

- **Model and access availability drift.** Google announced the 2026-06-18 consumer Gemini CLI transition; Gemini model IDs served by the CLI also change over time. This plugin keeps a GA fallback for unavailable Gemini model IDs. See [Model Alias Notes](#model-alias-notes) and [docs/MODEL_COMPARISON.md](docs/MODEL_COMPARISON.md).
- **`/gemini:review` is a prompt/CLI adapter, not a native reviewer.** It sends the diff with a review prompt and parses the structured JSON, rather than using an app-server reviewer, so its feedback depth differs from a native one. See [Codex app server vs Gemini CLI adapter](#codex-app-server-vs-gemini-cli-adapter).
